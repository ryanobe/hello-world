This is a repository to practice using GitHub with.
The research I am using GitHub for is looking into a quality control process for pre-stressed concrete railroad ties. The work deals with measuring cracks in concrete beams reinforced with idented wires along with creating and working with scans of the indented wire profiles. The coding for the reading of these files is being done in Python.
